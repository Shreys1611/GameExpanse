# The Game of Success - A GameExpanse Hackathon Project

This repository contains the available source code for "The Game of Success," a 3D allegorical game developed in just 36 hours for the 'Game Expanse' hackathon.

Our concept was recognized with an honorary award for **"Best Game Idea and Story"** at the event.

### üéÆ The Concept: Life as a Game

"The Game of Success" translates the challenges and opportunities of life into engaging gameplay mechanics. Each level was designed to represent a different stage or obstacle in a person's life, from navigating the confusing maze of early choices to dodging the unexpected hurdles of a career. The core message was that success is a holistic measure, rewarding players who explore co-curricular activities and hidden paths, not just those who rush to the finish line.

### üèÜ My Contributions

As a core member of the team, I focused on bridging the gap between design and implementation. My key responsibilities included:

* **Level Design:** I designed the layout and flow for the primary game levels, including the maze and obstacle course. My focus was on creating a path that was both challenging to navigate and rewarding to explore.
* **Gameplay Programming (Scoring Systems):** I developed the C# scripts for the point and high score systems. This involved creating the logic to track player progress, award points for collecting different types of items, and save the final high score.

### Project Status

**Please note:** This repository serves as a record of the award-winning concept and the code developed during the 36-hour hackathon. Due to the nature of the rapid prototyping event, a final playable build and visual assets are not available.
